# Feature Specification: PetSalon Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-petsalon-system`
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: ".NET 8 + Vue 3 + TypeScript + SQL ServerÔºåÊîØÊè¥Ê°åÈù¢ÂíåË°åÂãïË£ùÁΩÆ"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Pet Registration & Management (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

As a pet grooming staff member, I need to register new pets and maintain their information so that I can provide personalized grooming services and track their history.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the entire system. Without pet data, no other features (reservations, subscriptions, payments) can function. This delivers immediate value by digitizing pet records.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new pet record with name, breed, gender, birthday, pricing, and photo. Staff can view, edit, and manage pet information without requiring any other features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no pets exist in the system, **When** I click "Add New Pet" and enter pet details (name, breed, gender, birthday, pricing), **Then** the system creates a pet record with a unique ID
2. **Given** a pet exists, **When** I upload a pet photo (JPG/PNG/GIF), **Then** the system stores the photo securely and displays it in the pet profile
3. **Given** a pet record exists, **When** I update pricing information (normal price, subscription price), **Then** the system saves the new pricing and uses it for future calculations
4. **Given** multiple pets exist, **When** I search by pet name or filter by breed, **Then** the system displays matching pets instantly
5. **Given** a pet record exists, **When** I view pet details on mobile device, **Then** the interface adapts to mobile screen with touch-friendly controls

### User Story 2 - Contact Person Management (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

As a staff member, I need to manage pet owners and their contact information so that I can communicate with them about appointments and send reminders.

**Why this priority**: Essential for business operations. Staff need to know who to contact for appointments, payment follow-ups, and emergencies. Works independently but naturally complements pet management.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating contact persons with phone numbers, linking them to pets with relationship types (owner, family, caregiver), and managing contact lists.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no contacts exist, **When** I add a new contact person with name, nickname, and phone number, **Then** the system creates a contact record
2. **Given** a contact person and a pet exist, **When** I link them with relationship type "Owner", **Then** the system establishes the relationship and shows it in both profiles
3. **Given** a pet has multiple contacts, **When** I view the pet profile, **Then** the system displays all linked contacts with their relationship types
4. **Given** a contact person exists, **When** I search for them by name or phone number, **Then** the system quickly locates and displays their profile
5. **Given** viewing contacts on mobile, **When** I tap a phone number, **Then** the device prompts to make a call

### User Story 3 - Appointment Booking & Calendar (Priority: P2)

As a staff member, I need to book grooming appointments and view them in a calendar format so that I can manage daily schedules and avoid overbooking.

**Why this priority**: Core business function that depends on Pet and Contact data. Enables revenue generation through service bookings.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating appointments with date/time, selecting services, viewing calendar, and managing appointment statuses (pending, confirmed, in-progress, completed, cancelled).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pet exists, **When** I create a new appointment with date, time, and service type, **Then** the system books the appointment and shows it in the calendar
2. **Given** multiple appointments exist, **When** I view the calendar, **Then** the system displays appointments color-coded by status with time slots
3. **Given** an appointment exists, **When** I change its status to "Confirmed", **Then** the system updates the status and sends notification (if configured)
4. **Given** viewing calendar on mobile, **When** I tap an appointment, **Then** a bottom sheet shows appointment details with action buttons
5. **Given** an appointment has a pet with subscription, **When** I view appointment details, **Then** the system shows available subscription and suggests using it

### User Story 4 - Subscription Package Management (Priority: P2)

As a staff member, I need to create and manage monthly subscription packages for pets so that I can offer discounted grooming services and ensure recurring revenue.

**Why this priority**: Important for customer retention and predictable revenue. Builds on Pet management. Integrates with appointments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating subscriptions with start/end dates, usage limits, tracking used/reserved counts, and checking availability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pet exists, **When** I create a monthly subscription with 4 grooming sessions, **Then** the system records the subscription with start/end dates and usage limits
2. **Given** a subscription exists, **When** I book an appointment using the subscription, **Then** the system reserves one count and updates remaining usage
3. **Given** a reservation is confirmed, **When** the grooming is completed, **Then** the system deducts the reserved count from the subscription
4. **Given** a subscription is about to expire, **When** 7 days remain, **Then** the system flags it for renewal reminder
5. **Given** viewing subscriptions on mobile, **When** I swipe a subscription card, **Then** quick actions appear (renew, view usage, cancel)

---

### User Story 5 - Payment & Financial Tracking (Priority: P3)

As a business owner, I need to track all income and expenses so that I can monitor financial health and generate reports for decision-making.

**Why this priority**: Important for business insights but not blocking daily operations. Can be added after core workflow is established.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by recording payment transactions (income from grooming, retail, subscriptions; expenses for utilities, rent, supplies), categorizing them, and generating financial reports.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an appointment is completed, **When** I mark it as paid, **Then** the system automatically creates a payment record with income type "Grooming"
2. **Given** I purchase supplies, **When** I record an expense with type "Supplies" and amount, **Then** the system logs it in the expense ledger
3. **Given** multiple transactions exist, **When** I view monthly financial report, **Then** the system shows total income, total expenses, and net profit with category breakdowns
4. **Given** viewing financial dashboard on tablet, **When** I pinch to zoom charts, **Then** the charts scale responsively with touch gestures
5. **Given** I need to export data, **When** I select date range and export format, **Then** the system generates downloadable report

---

### User Story 6 - System Administration & Reporting (Priority: P3)

As a system administrator, I need to manage system codes, user accounts, and generate analytics reports so that I can maintain the system and gain business insights.

**Why this priority**: Necessary for long-term maintenance but not required for MVP launch. Can be added iteratively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by managing system codes (breeds, genders, service types, statuses), configuring user roles, and generating reports on reservations, subscriptions, and revenue trends.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm an admin user, **When** I add a new breed to SystemCode, **Then** the breed appears in pet registration dropdowns across the system
2. **Given** multiple users exist, **When** I assign "Admin" role to a user, **Then** they gain access to system administration features
3. **Given** 3 months of data exist, **When** I generate quarterly report, **Then** the system shows trends in appointments, popular services, and revenue growth
4. **Given** viewing admin panel on desktop, **When** I access audit logs, **Then** the system displays all data modifications with user and timestamp
5. **Given** system codes need updates, **When** I edit a code type on mobile, **Then** the form adapts with proper input controls

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a pet photo upload exceeds 10MB size limit?
  ‚Üí System rejects upload and displays error message with size limit

- How does system handle double-booking (same time slot)?
  ‚Üí System prevents overlapping appointments by validating time conflicts before saving

- What happens when a subscription expires but appointments are still using it?
  ‚Üí System flags expired subscriptions and prevents new reservations, but honors existing confirmed appointments

- How does system handle network loss during mobile appointment booking?
  ‚Üí Frontend caches form data in local storage and prompts to retry when connection returns

- What happens when a contact person is deleted but pets are still linked?
  ‚Üí System prevents deletion if pets are linked, requires unlinking first or reassigning pets

- How does system handle concurrent edits by multiple staff members?
  ‚Üí Last-write-wins with optimistic concurrency using ModifyTime field; shows warning if data changed
